This Python script has two main functions. 
The first, extract_dates_dollar_amounts_account_numbers, identifies and extracts dates (valid, with typos, or without years), dollar amounts, and 4-digit account numbers from an input Excel file using regular expressions. 
It outputs the extracted data into specified cells in another worksheet while preventing duplicates. 
The second function, clear_and_paste_into_one_cell, clears all content in a target worksheet, saves the changes, and simulates a "paste in edit mode" operation using pyautogui. 
Together, these functions handle data extraction and automated Excel interaction, requiring manual preparation for "edit mode" operations. 
The script leverages libraries like openpyxl and pyautogui.
